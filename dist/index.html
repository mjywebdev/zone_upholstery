              <p>
                Gary has an extensive Library of sample fabrics from different manufacturers enabling a choice to suit. We decided that comfort was our main aim and went for a vintage Parker Knoll three seat settee, a PK York chair, a PK Hartley chair, a Halo French flea market chair plus a long low footstool would do the trick. Arm covers for all seats were made to help wear and to keep clean. Gary is prepared to work with you to meet your needs, which in our case included firmer cushions on the settee and extra lumbar support for the York chair. We are well pleased with the service. Gary worked to the timetable which he set and we are now '' wallowing in comfort'' on our smart newly upholstered suite. Thanks. Eric and Pat.

                A credit to the reupholstery industry
              </h3>
              <p>
                Zone Upholstery have recently reupholstered our 3 piece suite and six dining chairs which was originally hand made by them. This suite is now 14 years old and was so well made that we opted to up-cycle and have the cushions reupholstered and new foam. They have made an amazing job and it looks stunning, was excellent value for money and completed on time as promised. The customer service we received was exceptional; nothing was too much trouble. They are a credit to their industry and we have no hesitation in recommending them. We will definitely return for repeat business, in fact we would not go anywhere else!
